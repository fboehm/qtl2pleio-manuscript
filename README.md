# qtl2pleio-manuscript
Resources from the qtl2pleio manuscript, "A test to distinguish close linkage from pleiotropy in multiparental populations"


There are 2 subdirectories in this repository:

1. Rmd  
2. chtc  

## Rmd contents

Rmd contains Rmarkdown files and github markdown documents (ie, the output from the Rmarkdown documents). It also contains saved png files for use in the manuscript. 

## chtc contents

Much of the computing was done through the Center for High-Throughput Computing at UW-Madison. I have placed the needed files for use with the chtc in this subdirectory. 

There are 3 subdirectories:

1. Recla-bootstrap
2. type-I-error-rate-study
3. power-study


## Contents of chtc/Recla-bootstrap

Within Recla-bootstrap, there are 5 subdirectories: 

1. submit_files  
2. Rscript  
3. shell_scripts  
4. squid
5. data

Each contains 3 files, all of which we used in analysis of the Recla data. Additional files are needed to fully reproduce our analysis. For example, several files are placed on a squid server for fast transfer when using the CHTC. We've placed the needed files in the "squid" subdirectory. We've also placed the necessary data files in the subdirectory "data".
